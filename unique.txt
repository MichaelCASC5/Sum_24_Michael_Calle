Unique Features:
	My program uses 3D math to display the sprites with a 3D effect.
	I also added a Camera class to account for 3D movement and position.
	I also added a KeyBuffer class to allow for smoother and continuous input.

Rules:
	There are no rules other than looking around. Here are the controls:

	WASD: Lateral translation.
	ARROW KEYS: Camera rotation.
	SPACE AND CTRL: Vertical translation.
